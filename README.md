##  About Me

I’m **Elvis Taruh**, an ambitious and dedicated **AI & Machine Learning Engineer** with a strong foundation in computer vision, predictive modeling, and intelligent application development.

I completed my **Master’s degree in Artificial Intelligence (2025)** at the University of Donja Gorica with a thesis titled **“Development of Edge/AI Applications with HPC Support.”** My academic work focused on building scalable AI solutions that leverage high-performance computing to optimize training and deployment workflows.

Earlier, I graduated with a **Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems and Technologies**, where I completed a thesis on *“Artificial Intelligence in Video Games.”*

I also contributed to research presented at the **XIX International Symposium SymOrg 2024**, co-authoring the paper *“Detection of Scoliosis,”* which applied deep learning techniques to medical image analysis.
